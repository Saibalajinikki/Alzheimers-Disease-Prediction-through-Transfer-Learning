# Alzheimer's Disease Prediction through Transfer Learning

This project aims to develop a predictive model for Alzheimer's disease using transfer learning techniques. The model is designed to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of Alzheimer's disease.

## Project Overview

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects memory and cognitive function. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for managing and treating the disease. This project utilizes transfer learning with pre-trained neural networks to create a predictive model based on patient data.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing and understanding the data through various plots and statistical summaries.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features to enhance the model's predictive power.
- **Model Building:** Implementing and evaluating different machine learning algorithms.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Deployment:** Preparing the model for deployment in a real-world environment.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features related to patient demographics, medical history, and cognitive test results. The data has been anonymized to protect patient privacy.

## Notebooks

- `Alzheimers_sample.ipynb`: This notebook contains the complete workflow for the project, including data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## Installation

To run the notebooks and reproduce the results, you need to set up a Python environment with the required libraries. You can use the following steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Saibalajinikki/Alzheimers-Disease-Prediction-through-Transfer-Learning.git
   cd Alzheimers-Disease-Prediction-through-Transfer-Learning
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

Open the `Alzheimers_sample.ipynb` notebook and run the cells in sequence to preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis, engineer features, build the models, and evaluate their performance.
